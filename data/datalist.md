# GWAS
For initial GWAS examples/labs, we used HapMap CEU data with a simulated binary phenotype from the [2018 GWAS tutorial by Marees et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001694/).

Data can be found here: https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA_tutorial/1_QC_GWAS.zip

# Ancestry Inference
