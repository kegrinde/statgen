# Statistical Genetics
This repository contains course materials for the advanced undergraduate course *STAT 494: Statistical Genetics* at Macalester College

## Course Description

Statistical methods for analyzing genetic data and understanding the genetic basis of human diseases and traits are at the heart of government-sponsored precision medicine initiatives, genetic testing routinely conducted at health clinics, and direct-to-consumer genetic and ancestry testing offered by companies like 23andMe and AncestryDNA. Statistical geneticists work to answer these important scientific questions while navigating the unique statistical challenges posed by genetic data such as their large size (p >> n), complicated correlation structure, sparsity, and observational nature. In this course, we will explore the statistical methods that have been proposed to address these challenges, applying ideas from other statistics courses (e.g., linear models, hypothesis testing, classification, principal component analysis, probability theory) in the context of genetic data. Specific topics of focus will include genome-wide association studies, genetic ancestry inference, admixture mapping, and more. Prior knowledge of genetics and methods from statistical machine learning will be helpful, but are not formally required. This course will include a final project that could be presented at the MSCS Capstone Days.
